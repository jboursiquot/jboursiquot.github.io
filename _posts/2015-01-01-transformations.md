We're at the start of a new year and customarily, many of us will be committing to do or not do certain things during the year.

While I dislike the ritualistic new year’s resolutions we make (and subsequently struggle to keep), I am not immune to the need for self-improvement and do hope for several personal transformations this year:

* Produce more, consume less.
* Delegate more.
* Trust more.
* Learn more.
* Give more of my time and self.
* Lead a more disciplined life.

These are broad in a sense. I’ve been thinking about what these things ultimately boil down to in terms of my day-to-day. Over the next couple of weeks I aim to elaborate on specific areas of my life that can benefit from each of these principles.

If you’ve made some resolutions of your own, I hope you succeed in staying committed to them.

Here’s to a 2015 full of possibilities.
