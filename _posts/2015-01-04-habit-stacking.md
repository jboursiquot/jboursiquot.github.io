Earlier today I came across the title *Habit Stacking* by S.J. Scott. It claimed to offer a "system" for creating good habits.

Since I'm always interested in techniques to establish productive routines in my life, I used one of my [Audible](http://www.audible.com) credits and downloaded the book. At 2 hours and 14 minutes, it wasn't a long listen. I usually listen at 1.5x speed anyways so I knew I could fit this in during my evening routine at home with the family.

While the "system" presented in the book felt more like a series of common sense approaches, it did provide a straightforward set of actions to take to "stack" small 4-10 minute habits you might be trying to develop.

Overall, I'd recommend this title to anybody who wants to take a first step at creating routines they can apply from sun-up to sun-down.

Here's the [link to the audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/Habit-Stacking-Audiobook/B00L892S98).

Here's to building good habits.
