In [my last post](/2015/01/01/transformations.html), I listed several improvements or transformations I wanted to undergo in 2015. The first, “produce more, consume less”, implied that my existing production to consumption ratio was tilted towards the latter.

To clarify, much of the content I consume on a regular basis falls in the “useful later but not right now” category. This translates into a lot of accumulated knowledge of what’s out there but with delayed usefulness. Considering my line of work (software engineering) and its inherent requirement of keeping up with the latest techniques and tools, consuming a lot of content is really part of my life.

So then, if consumption isn’t going anywhere, what does that mean for the production side of things? Well, another point of clarification is that the work I produce now is effectively all behind closed doors. I work with companies that do not have an explicit policy for contributing back to Open Source—at least not through code. This, at times, makes me feel that I in turn do not contribute back very often. At the time of this writing, my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jboursiquot) has a half-dozen or so projects I’d consider useful to others but nowhere near the number it ought to be (at least in my mind) given how long I’ve been a developer. Perhaps I would actually feel more productive if I just **complete and ship** small projects and proof of concepts on a much more regular basis than I do now.

The bottom line then is that in order to start my “produce more, consume less” transformation, I must focus on delivering small (and meaningful) projects. These efforts will not necessarily be libraries for other developers to use (although that’s entirely possible) but rather, they will be designed to give me a sense of accomplishment and an opportunity to implement some of the knowledge I continuously accumulate.
