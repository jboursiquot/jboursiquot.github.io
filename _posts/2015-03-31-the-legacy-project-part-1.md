Ever thought about your legacy?

I ask with the assuming that you, dear reader, writes or wrote software for a living. 

A few weeks ago, it dawned on me that I had been designing and building software of various kinds for close to two decades. I was lucky enough to know what I wanted to do in life at an early age and have never looked back. That said, I've got nothing on those who have been in this industry for three, four or more decades.

Despite being young at this craft by comparison to some of my more experienced peers, I have started thinking about my legacy. Thinking about the positions I've held over the years, the roles I've played on projects, the successes and failures I've experienced, I get the sense that my legacy would have to encompass more than just the code I've written.

While I can't remember that brilliant or crapy code I wrote ten years ago, I can more than likely remember some of the people I've worked with and perhaps some of the projects I've been a part of. 

I've begun to wonder if others in my position might also be thinking about their careers in this way. Better yet, I'm wondering if peers who are either well into their careers or retired from it might have some insights to share.

As of last week, I've launched an effort to seek out and interview as many veteran software engineers as are willing in order to understand how they view their legacy, what they valued most out of their long careers and what insights can be passed on to the next generation.

More to come.
