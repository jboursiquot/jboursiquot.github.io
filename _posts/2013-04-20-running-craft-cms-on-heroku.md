### Risks

Before we begin, note that the Craft team does not officially support this
deployment method. You take on the risk of things not working
perfectly with current or future versions of the software. That
said, this post is as much of a nudge for the Craft team as it is for
you, the hacker, to experience the benefits of running this application 
without having to provision web, application and database servers.

### Heroku Supports PHP?

Yes, but not by default. While doing some research around this topic,
I came across quite a bit of fear and trepidation when it
comes to deploying PHP applications on Heroku's platform. After digging
a bit deeper, I came to understand why the fear exists and am
comfortable enough stating that you can run your PHP applications on
Heroku without fear, the same way you can run your Ruby, Scala, Clojure,
Java and Python applications. The key here lies in Heroku's use of
"buildpacks" which I'll discuss in greater detail in another post. For
now, we'll jump into deploying Craft CMS.
